# 100-Day-of-Code Study Plan for DSA and Placement Preparation

Welcome to the 100-Day Study Plan for DSA and Placement Preparation. This study plan is designed to help beginners learn data structures and algorithms, practice coding, and prepare for placement interviews. The plan is divided into 13 weeks, with each week consisting of six study days and one revision day.

Throughout the development of this study plan, I consulted with seniors and experts in the field to ensure that it is comprehensive and effective. Additionally, I placed a strong emphasis on consistency and creating a sustainable study routine, which is crucial for achieving success in any long-term endeavor. By following this plan diligently, you can expect to make significant progress in your understanding of data structures and algorithms, as well as improve your problem-solving skills and prepare for placement interviews.
